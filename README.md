# rpi-led-lightshow

Perform a sexy light show with your Raspberry Pi and some LEDs!

## How do I set this up?

The setup for this program is *very* similar to that of
[rpi-volume-led](https://github.com/mwiens91/rpi-volume-led). The readme
for that project has all the instructions you'll need, and the program
itself comes with tests which make troubleshooting easy if anything goes
wrong.

## How does it work?

The core of the lightshow is based on frequency analysis (and the core
of *that* is the Fast Fourier Transform), which is supplemented by a few
other techniques to make the light show as tight as possible ("hit"
thresholds, averaging).

## How does it look?
